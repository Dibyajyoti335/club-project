# club-project
# Introduced to the python libraries such as tensorflow,PIL,Glob,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn and data preprocessing
# Imported the Flowers dataset(having 16 classes) from kaggle and classify the different classes using tensorflow
# Implemented the Sequential model using keras layers on X-Ray image dataset with an accuracy of 82% on the test data
# Fed the pre trained weights of ResNet50 to two dense layered classifier with an accuracy of 86% on fashion mnist dataset
# Implemented the model build using keras hyperparameter tuning on flower dataset imported from kaggle
